    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Created by salamanders who would have to guess at which rock their neighbors were laying, this has been around for ages. Some would say since the phyla amphibians forked in the great tree of life.</p>
